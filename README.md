opinions.technology
===================

If you think an adjective doesn't make sense, want to add your own, or have some other technology you have opinions on, please make a pull request!

If you are submitting technologies or adjectives, please do it at the end of the file and do not mess with ids of previous entries (I'm link them by id for votes). If you add a bunch of stuff and don't want to do the id manually, just use Excel (importing/exporting as CSV)

Adjectives taken from https://github.com/dariusk/corpora Some adjectives were either removed for not being applicable or modified

TODO: Voting, scorekeeping (what adjectives are liked most/least with tech, what tech is liked more/less with an adjective), maybe this should be an app?
